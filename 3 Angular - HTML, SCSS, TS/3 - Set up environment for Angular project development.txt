download and install (install with basic suggested settings): 
	nodeJS latest stable verion (LTS) from https://nodejs.org/en/
	GIT from https://gitforwindows.org/
	interface for GIT from https://tortoisegit.org/ (optional (You can use git bash from CLI))
	
after you installed these programs, you can use GIT version control, and can easily get a clone from accessible projects like this:
	get the project git url to your clipboard (ctrl + c) (get this for first example: https://gitlab.com/Itharen/scheme-project)
	go to the directory, where you want to make the project to take place, than with right click -> GIT Clone... , if I'm correct, tortoise will automatically copy the url from clipboard to the URL field, and also will automatically set the destenation folder as well, so your only job is to press ok
	
run from CLI (Command Line Interface):
	CLI (on windows) is accessable by...
		cmd: search "run" in windows start, then run "cmd" (boom that's the conlose)
		power shell (recommended): search "powerShell" in windows start
			I also recommend to make shortcut for CLI
	from CLI:
		if your directory is on another drive than C:, like E:, than type:
			E:
		go to your directory with:
			cd ProgrammingIsland/Own/scheme-project
			if you need to go back, use
				..
				like from C:\Users\Bob> it will be cd ../../theFolder/YourProject/WillBe
		than run:
			npm install -g @angular/cli
		now you are able to create, run and build angular projects!
		
		if you cloned an existing project, you need to install the packages for it with running the following code in the project directory:
			npm i
		and your Angular project is good to go. run with:
			ng serve -o
			this will automatically open it for you, and will refresh any time, you save modifications! (note that it not always reloads perfectly when you modify something in a module)
		
		if you cloned the scheme-project, create your own branch by...
			right click on project folder -> TortoiseGit -> Switch/Checkout
				click on Create New Branch, and write your username (this will be the name of the branch) in to the field
					then OK
			BOOM, you have your very own branch,
				now you can play(ruin the project) as you want without messing it up for everyone else ;)
