        <!-- CSS is moved to another file, this makes the code more simple, and separates -->
        <!-- you can split the Visual Code Editor by clicking on the top right corner 'Split Editor Right', this way you can open/edit more files simultaneously -->
        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="1.1.0.css"> 
        <!-- 
            If the imported file is in the same folder as the html file, you dont need to bother with it.
            But if your file is in a folder next to the html, you need to add the path to the href, like this: "folderName/subfolderNameIfNeeded/1.1.0.css"
            also you can go up in folders with "..", like this: "../../1.1.0.css"
        -->

        <!-- 
            When you are developing HTML + CSS, I recommend you to open both files the same time by Splitting the editor in Visual Studio Code (top right corner) (ctrl + Å±), 
            also I recommend to use this function every time you edit multiple files
        -->
