// JavaScript files are going to be compiled by the browser as you read, from top to bottom, from left to right

// JavaScript functions can be found in javascript documentation: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String

// this is a commented line, this won't be compiled

/* 
  you also can use multiple line commenting with this,
    also, this can be added or removed automatically in Visual Studio Code, after highlight, with: shift + alt + a
*/

// this is a declaration of a function
function helloWorld () {
  alert( 'Hello, world!' );
}
// the spaces between different sections and line breaks in code are only for transparency, so the code will be compiled the same way if you remove all of them like this:
function helloWorld(){alert('Hello, world!');}
// also since I redeclared the function with the same name (helloWorld), the second one will overwrite the first one

helloWorld(); // this will call the already declared helloWorld function, you also can call this from the browser's console
// while you learning, always try these things in console
// you also can paste the whole code in console as well, but try avoid this and use the least code to test these
// play with the codes! make your own copies from these lessons and rewrite them

// dont spend too much time memorizing syntaxes, you can find them any time on the internet!
// your only task is to understand the concepts


// in the next steps, I will show you, how to create variables, and how to manage them

// one of the most used function is console.log (this is included in the browser)
// reminder: console can be opened with F12 in browser
console.log('Hello World!');
