I created this txt file to felp you get back on track in case you skipped some time between to lessons.

Dont forget to open the whole course folder in Visual Studio Code.
Open every lesson's html file in browser, open browser console with F12, and try to call functions there.
There are also some helping snippets in the START HERE file, so you might need to open it from time to time.
It is easier to follow guides and check screens if you have 2 or more monitors, one for the code (VSC), and one for the running version in browser
If you face any issue or question, don't hesitate to ask Tahi-Tóth Balázs.

try to do some testing, like try out everything that comes to your mind!
    try to break the code,
    try the functions
    try to add codes or variables throught the console
        etc
also try to write your own codes with different namings...

...and once again, don't forget to call the sample functions in the console!

(lessons are having some parts from previous lessons this is for practicing and repeat, 
    so don't skip them but make sure, you understand what is in)
